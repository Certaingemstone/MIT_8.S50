    "Congratulations! You have reached the end of the tutorial. Parameter estimation is a tough problem in gravitational-wave physics (and many other areas of physics) due to the intractable nature of the posterior distribution. Posterior sampling algorithms, such as MCMC and Nested Sampling, help solve this problem at a cost of long run-time. This makes it difficult to perform electromagnetic follow-up of time-sensitive GW sources like binary neutron stars. \n",
